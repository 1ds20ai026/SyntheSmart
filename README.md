# SyntheSmart

"SyntheSmart is an AI-powered content summarization web application that I built using Streamlit and LangChain. It allows users to automatically generate comprehensive summaries of content from both YouTube videos and web articles by simply pasting a URL." Key Technical Features:

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Streamlit for the web interface Backend: LangChain for AI integration AI Model: Groq's Gemma-7b-it model for text processing Additional Tools: YoutubeLoader and UnstructuredURLLoader for content extraction

Main Functionalities:

URL validation and content type detection Support for both YouTube videos (including transcript extraction) and web articles Intelligent content processing using a map-reduce summarization chain Real-time progress tracking with progress bars Downloadable summaries

Architecture Highlights:

Modular design with separate functions for content loading and processing Error handling and fallback mechanisms for YouTube content Custom prompt templates for consistent summarization Responsive UI with custom CSS styling

Technical Challenges: "One interesting challenge was handling YouTube content reliably. I implemented a fallback mechanism using multiple methods to extract video transcripts, ensuring the application remains functional even if the primary extraction method fails."

User Experience: "I focused on creating an intuitive interface with clear visual feedback. The application includes progress tracking, error messages, and even displays YouTube video metadata when available. The summary output is formatted for readability and can be easily downloaded." Scalability/Improvements: "The application is built with scalability in mind. It uses environment variables for API keys and could easily be extended to support additional content types or summary formats. Potential improvements could include multi-language support or customizable summarization parameters." Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the project that you'd like to focus on during the interview?
